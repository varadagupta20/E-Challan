# E-Challan System

INTRODUCTION
The main idea of this project is to provide an online platform to the user and a convenient way to pay their penalties for a traffic violation. The database will consist of all the violators’ previous history and their credentials, which can be verified and a penalty can be imposed in case of any traffic violation. The main aim of the project is to reduce the paperwork and manual processes and increase the convenience for the users.

PROJECT OVERVIEW
The front end will be accessible to two types of users - the traffic Policeman imposing a fine and the violator of the traffic rule, who pays for the imposed fine. Every eligible driver has a unique driving license no. And every traffic policeman has a unique employee id no.
● The policeman imposing the fine can log in through his unique username and his password. He can verify the violator's driving details. After verification, he can impose the necessary penalties and remarks against the violator’s license.
● The violator will be given a certain amount of time to pay his fine and penalty. The user can login through his unique username and custom password after verification. If the user does not pay his fees in the due time he will be imposed an additional penalty per day delayed.
This management system will help in reducing the paperwork and improve the convenience for the users.
